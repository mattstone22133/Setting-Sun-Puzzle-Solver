# Setting-Sun-Puzzle-Solver
Code that generates a shortest path solution to solving the setting sun puzzle. 

During winter break, I recieved a setting sun puzzle as a christmas gift. I wanted to try and create a program that could solve the puzzle in the 
shortest possible path from any configuration which is what I did over the past few days.

This code should work without any set up required.
