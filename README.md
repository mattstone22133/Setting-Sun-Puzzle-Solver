# Setting-Sun-Puzzle-Solver
Code that generates a shortest path solution to solving the setting sun puzzle. 

During winter break, I received a setting sun puzzle as a Christmas gift. I wanted to try and create a program that could solve the puzzle in the 
shortest possible path from any configuration. This is what I have created over the last few days to solve the problem.

This code should work without any set up required.
